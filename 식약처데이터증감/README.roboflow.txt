The dataset includes 2341 images.
Pills are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 62 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -14° to +14° horizontally and -19° to +19° vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 9 percent of pixels
